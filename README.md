# smite-recommender

Make item recommendations for Smite gods when playing with or against other specific gods.


You can interact with the different item recommendations using smite-recommender-widget notebook. Unfortunately, at the moment, the only way to access it is by having Jupyter installed, downloading the notebook and the SMITE_recommendations folder in the same directory, and running the notebook through Jupyter.

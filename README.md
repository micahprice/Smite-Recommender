# smite-recommender

What items go well with/against certain gods in Smite? Let's find out!


A regularized logistic regression supplies a rating for each item as it tries to predict which items lead to a win. Using this information, we suggest useful alternatives to the most popular items used.

You can interact with different item recommendations using the `smite-recommender-app` [Shiny app](http://micahprice.shinyapps.io/smite-recommender-app) hosted by R Studios. Check it out! More information about the recommendations there. Due to size restrictions the app only has information for Conquest and Duel game modes.

You can also interact with the different item recommendations using the `smite-recommender-widget` [notebook](https://github.com/micahprice/smite-recommender/blob/master/smite-recommender-widget.ipynb). The widget is a bit prettier than the Shiny app. Unfortunately, at the moment, the only way to access it is by having [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed, downloading the notebook and the [SMITE_recommendations] (https://github.com/micahprice/smite-recommender/tree/master/SMITE_recommendations) folder in the same directory, and running the notebook through Jupyter. You will also need to have [`ipywidgets`] (https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets#install) installed.

EDIT: You can now interact with http://micahprice.shinyapps.io/smite-recommender-app

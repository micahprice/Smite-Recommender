# smite-recommender

What items go well with/against certain gods in Smite? Let's find out!


A regularized logistic regression supplies a rating for each item as it tries to predict which items lead to a win. Using this information, we suggest useful alternatives to the most popular items used.

You can interact with the different item recommendations using the `smite-recommender-widget` [notebook](https://github.com/micahprice/smite-recommender/blob/master/smite-recommender-widget.ipynb). More information about the recommendations there.

Unfortunately, at the moment, the only way to access it is by having [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed, downloading the notebook and the [SMITE_recommendations] (https://github.com/micahprice/smite-recommender/tree/master/SMITE_recommendations) folder in the same directory, and running the notebook through Jupyter. You will also need to have [`ipywidgets`] (https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets#install) installed.
